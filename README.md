Conquer is a productivity app which allows users to divide their tasks and goals into five segments: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and long term. Users can create, update, prioritize, postpone and delete tasks in all these sections. They can also add friends and share tasks with their friends. This is available both as a [web](https://conquer-goals.netlify.app/) and [android](https://github.com/devout-coder/conquer-rn-app/releases) app
