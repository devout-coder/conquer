Conquer is a productivity app which allows users to divide their tasks and goals into five segments: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and long term. Users can create, update, prioritize and delete tasks in all these sections. This is available both as a [web](https://conquer-goals.netlify.app/) and [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.conquer_app) app

This repo handles the android web app of conquer. [This repo](https://github.com/devout-coder/conquer-rn-app) has the code for the android app of conquer.

## Tech Stack used:

I have primarily used React and Firebase for this app.

## Upcoming features for the web app:
1. Users will be allowed to postpone tasks
2. Nudger: a chrome extension to blacklist some of your distracting websites and getting a notification of the remaining tasks every 15 minutes you use the blacklisted websites. I came up with this idea as a better alternative to websites blockers: Website blockers block the website completely but there are websites like Youtube which are used for both entertainment and educational purposes. So instead having something which induces guilt in you every 15 minutes you use such a website makes more sense...
3. Ability to share tasks with multiple users
4. Google calendar integration for daily tasks
